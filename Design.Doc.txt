Goal: Protect my web search from other users on my local network
+ Domain
+ data packets


The system captures IP packets via a TUN interface, encrypts the payload, and 
encapsulates them in UDP datagrams for transport


Getting the data

in linux everything is a file
we need to open `dev/net/tun` to get the file descriptor

#include <sys/ioctl.h>
+ `ioctl()`
return value : 0 on success, -1 and errno on fail
Flag : IFF_TUN for the IP packets


Handling the data

while (1)
{
	select()
	{
		read() from the TUN file descriptor into a buffer
		encrypt the buffer using `libsodium`
	}
}

Movin the data

we will create a UDP socket to move the data to the VPS
sendto() the server IP

On the server side
we will write to `write()` the decrpted data into server's TUN interface
we will enable MASQUERADE (NAT) in iptables (stamps the packet)
